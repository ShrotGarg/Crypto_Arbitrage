# Crypto_Arbitrage
Program that can be used to act on arbitrages that occur in inefficient CryptoCurrency markets.

So I have been messing around with stock markets, arbitrages, and the math related to all of it. Hence, I created my own program which utilizes the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find these opportunities and to trade them. It's only a simulation but it uses real life data. If it's optimized and properly deployed, I believe it can work but it needs to be changed a lot.
